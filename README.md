# `deno_doc`

A Rust crate to generate documentation for JavaScript and TypeScript modules.

This crate powers
[`deno doc`](https://deno.land/manual/tools/documentation_generator), but is not
Deno specific and can be used to write documentation generators for other
targets like Node or the browser as well.

## Usage from Deno CLI or Deploy

See [js/README.md](js/README.md).

## Rust Example

`examples/ddoc/main.rs` provides a minimal standalone binary demonstrating how
`deno_doc` can be used as a crate.

```shell
$ cargo run --example ddoc ../deno_std/http/mod.ts
```

## Developing

```shell
# build all targets
$ cargo build --all-targets

# test it
$ cargo test

# build js api
$ deno task build

# test it
$ deno task test
```

### HTML generation

If you want to work on the HTML generation aspect of deno_doc, these things will
help you:

`deno task tailwind`: this regenerates the transpiled tailwind from the css
files and mentions of classes across the codebases, be it in rust files or js
files. This needs to always be run to do any updates to the styling.

`deno task gen_html`: This generates a `generated_docs` directory which is the
HTML output based on the provided files.

`deno task debug`: this calls the above tailwind task, and then the gen_html
task with all the files from `tests/testdata/multiple` passed.

We recommend to use these tasks above to develop features or debug things,
rather than recompiling a dependent on this system, as it is much faster
iteration and easier to debug.

We use [insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta) testing tool for taking
snapshots of the html output. If you change the rendering of html output, or
change the fixture files for html testing, you need to update snapshot using
[cargo-insta](https://insta.rs/docs/quickstart/) command.

```
# update snapshots
cargo insta test

# review snapshots
cargo insta review
```

See [the insta docs](https://insta.rs/docs/quickstart/) for more details.

### HTML Internal structure

Most of the HTML generated, except if its in very small fragments (ie a single
element or two) is located in `src/html/templates`. This is also where scripts,
CSS and icons live. The `page` directory in it is an extension to that which
only relates to generation of a full-fledged documentation page (like
`deno doc`), and is not used when just generating fragments (like
https://jsr.io).

Rendering of a symbol is done in the `src/html/symbols` directory, in the
corresponding file depending on the type of the symbol. Namespace is a special
case as in it is used for things besides namespaces, for example the "all
symbols" page.

A collection of symbols that refer to the same symbol identifier (like lets say
having a class and namespace with the same name of `MySymbol`), are called a
"symbol group".

The markdown rendering is pluggable and a default renderer is available via the
`comrak` feature which enables a default markdown renderer using the crate with
the same name.

A internal struct is `ShortPath`, which is a wrapper around a `Url` instance
with some additional information, including the display value and if it is the
main entrypoint. In addition to this struct, we have another wrapper struct
named `DocNodeWithContext`, which contains a `DocNode` and information related
to it, like a resolved identifier for representing its name in a namespace, and
also data related to "property drilldown".

Property drilldown is what we call being able to view properties, methods and
other accessors on classes, interfaces and applicable variables and type
aliases. It however does not refer to an item in a namespace, as those have
their unique handling.
