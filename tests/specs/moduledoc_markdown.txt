 * ## Usage
 *
 * See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * `examples/lorem/main.rs` provides a minimal standalone binary demonstrating
 * how the library can be used as a crate.
 *
 * ```shell
 * $ cargo run --example lorem ../std/http/mod.ts
 * ```
 *
 * ## Developing
 *
 * ```shell
 * # build all targets
 * $ cargo build --all-targets
 *
 * # test it
 * $ cargo test
 *
 * # build api
 * $ task build
 *
 * # test it
 * $ task test
 * ```
 *
 * ### HTML generation
 *
 * Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
 * aliquip ex ea commodo consequat:
 *
 * `task tailwind`: this regenerates the transpiled tailwind from the css
 * files and mentions of classes across the codebases, be it in rust files or js
 * files. This needs to always be run to do any updates to the styling.
 *
 * `task gen_html`: This generates a `generated_docs` directory which is the
 * HTML output based on the provided files.
 *
 * `task debug`: this calls the above tailwind task, and then the gen_html
 * task with all the files from `tests/testdata/multiple` passed.
 *
 * Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore
 * eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident.
 *
 * We use [insta](https://example.com/insta) testing tool for taking
 * snapshots of the html output. If you change the rendering of html output, or
 * change the fixture files for html testing, you need to update snapshot using
 * [cargo-insta](https://example.com/insta/docs) command.
 *
 * ```
 * # update snapshots
 * cargo insta test
 *
 * # review snapshots
 * cargo insta review
 * ```
 *
 * See [the insta docs](https://example.com/insta/docs) for more details.
 *
 * ### Internal structure
 *
 * Most of the HTML generated, except if its in very small fragments (ie a single
 * element or two) is located in `src/html/templates`. This is also where scripts,
 * CSS and icons live. The `page` directory in it is an extension to that which
 * only relates to generation of a full-fledged documentation page, and is not
 * used when just generating fragments (like https://example.com).
 *
 * Rendering of a symbol is done in the `src/html/symbols` directory, in the
 * corresponding file depending on the type of the symbol. Namespace is a special
 * case as in it is used for things besides namespaces, for example the "all
 * symbols" page.
 *
 * A collection of symbols that refer to the same symbol identifier (like lets say
 * having a class and namespace with the same name of `MySymbol`), are called a
 * "symbol group".
 *
 * The markdown rendering is pluggable and a default renderer is available via the
 * `comrak` feature which enables a default markdown renderer using the crate with
 * the same name.
 *
 * An internal struct is `ShortPath`, which is a wrapper around a `Url` instance
 * with some additional information, including the display value and if it is the
 * main entrypoint. In addition to this struct, we have another wrapper struct
 * named `DocNodeWithContext`, which contains a `DocNode` and information related
 * to it, like a resolved identifier for representing its name in a namespace, and
 * also data related to "property drilldown".
 *
 * Property drilldown is what we call being able to view properties, methods and
 * other accessors on classes, interfaces and applicable variables and type
 * aliases. It however does not refer to an item in a namespace, as those have
 * their unique handling.
